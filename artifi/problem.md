# Artificial three-year-old
![](../images/artifi.png)

You've been challenged to write a program that simulates a typical
three-year-old in an epic yes/no-battle with a grown-up. Making an artificial
intelligence for this is easy. If the grown-up says `yes` you reply `no`, and
if the grown-up says `no` you reply `yes`.

Write a program using this amazing technology for simulating such a
three-year-old.

## Input
Input contains a single word, which is the word that the grown-up says. You may
assume this word is either `yes` or `no`.

## Output
Your program should output the three-year-old's reply to the grown-up.

## Sample input 1
```
yes
```

## Sample output 1
```
no
```

## Sample input 2
```
no
```

## Sample output 2
```
yes
```
