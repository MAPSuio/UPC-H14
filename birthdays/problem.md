# Happy birthday to you
![](../images/leap.png)

Your friend John is born February 29, 1980, which was a leap year.
In the gregorian calendar a leap year is a year containing one additional day
to keep the calendar synchronized with the astronomical year.
The sad thing about this is that John can't celebrate his birthday every year like the rest of us.
And, as we all know, the best is to celebrate a birthday in the weekend.
