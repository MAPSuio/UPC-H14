# A healthy supply of ministers
![](../images/healthy.png)

Erna Solberg needs your help in running the government, especially with regards
to finding a health minister. Being a health minister is a nightmare. You have
a seemingly infinity queue of people waiting for treatment. If someone dies
before they get treatment there will be a major outcry in the media, forcing
you to resign.

For Erna this is a major headache. Since the treatment capacity is limited,
sometimes it is inevitable that some patients die, even if the health minister
manages the patient queue perfectly. Erna must therefore have a few minister
candidates ready to take over at any time.

Using advanced statistical inference Erna's advisors have been able to work out
an estimate of how people will become sick during this term. Your job is to
make a program that, given this data, finds the number of minister candidates
Erna needs. The data contains a list of all the patients who are currently
waiting for treatment. Each of these patients have an estimated number of days
left to live if they don't get treatment. The data also contains a list of
patients expected to enter the queue in the future. For these patients the data
states the day they are expected to enter the queue, and how long they are
expected to live from that day if they don't get treatment.

You can assume that all of Erna's health ministers will execute their job
perfectly, i.e. managing the patient queue in an optimal way. It takes a day
for a minister to resign and for a new one to take over, so if two or more
patients die on the same day, only one new minister is needed on this day.

How many backup health will Erna need during her term?

## Input
The first line of input contains two integers _n_ and _d_, the number of
waiting patients on day _0_, and the number patients who will get sick in the
future..

Then follows a line with _n_ integers _e<sub>i</sub>_. _e<sub>i</sub>_
describes the expected number of days patient _i_ will live without treatment.
The patients come in no particular order.

Then follows _d_ lines with two integers _s<sub>j</sub>_ and _e<sub>j</sub>_,
describing patient _j_. Patient _j_ becomes sick (enters the hospital queue) on
day _s<sub>j</sub>_, and is expected to live _e<sub>j</sub>_ days without
treatment.

## Output
Output the number of backup-health ministers Erna will need in order to make it
through the term.
