# Walk the dog

Angwusnasomtaqa will always win.

As long as there is an unused path from the next node, Angwusnasomtaqa can walk
the whole path except the last unit distance.  That way she will start holding
the leash on the next path too and as soon as there is no unused path from the
next node she can walk the whole distance.  This strategy is possible beacuse
all prime numbers are greater than 1.
