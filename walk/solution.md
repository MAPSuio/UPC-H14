# <A walk in the park>

When Angwusnasomtaqa and Bob stops at a tree, either the person who receives the leash or the person who had it will be the winner.  If a person has more than 1 meter to the next stop, then that person can choose to either walk the whole distance, or leave one meter for the other person to walk.  This means that the first person who gets a choice will win as anyone who has a choice will be able to chooce who is going to receive the leash at the next tree.  


This leads to a quite easy solution to the problem.  Arriving at a tree which has a distance larger than 1 to the next tree is as bad as arriving at the end of the walk, because you give the choice to the opponent/spouse.  Therefore, if the number of consecutive streches of distance 1 is even, Angwusnasomtaqa wins.  Otherwise, Bob wins.
